# Section 1

Some text goes here.

And a second paragraph too.

## Section 1.1

* I like making lists
* They usually have multiple entries

1. This is a numbered list
2. It's not very long
   * But it has a sublist
   * Which is a little nifty

- [x] This is a todo list
- [ ] It's not complete

# Section 2

Let's try _formatting_ *some* **TEXT**!
It's also pretty cool that you can ~~strikeout~~ text, and add in `code`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "This is a bash script in a document!"
```

# Section 3

## Links

* [Links](#links) are really helpful.
* [Sub Directory](subdirectory)
* [File in Sub Directory](subdirectory/File.md).
* [Absolute](/doc1.md)
* [Relative](./doc1.md)
* [File](doc1.md)
