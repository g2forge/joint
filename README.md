# Joint

Organizing, understanding and broadcasting information requires a joint effort.

Joint is a simple, static site generator currently supporting markdown and plantuml displayed through an Angular "wiki" site.
The site build system is fully automated from installing angular on your system to running a live reload server if desired.
For more information see the fat JAR for maven coordinates `com.g2forge.joint:jo-joint`, which has command line help.

The joint build system is extremely flexible, including support for complex back and front end components which will be exposed and documented more clearly in future releases.
